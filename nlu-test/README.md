The server for the NLU code test is built on Angular.

# Setup
I assume you have npm installed already. Run `npm i`.

# Running
Run `ng serve` in this directory to host the server. It will host on port 4200. You may also use the built version of the site in `../build`.

Make sure you have the attached server running! It is required to access the database, since Angular does not work well with the file system.
